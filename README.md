# Deadly Acceleration - Basic Juice Pack

## Introduction

This is an expansion mod for [Deadly Acceleration](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2422178213). It provides 
some basic juice items that act as consumables, preventing damage from too many g's.

## Features 

### Added items 

- Tier 1 "Crappy" juice. Will block 100 damage per bottle but give you 200% toxicity as well (100 toxicity for 50 damage blocked)
- Tier 2 "Decent" juice. Will block 100 damage per bottle _but_ only give you 100% toxicity and decays 10x faster than tier 1

They both have custom models and icons. My modelling skillz are not the best, sorry about that. Balance is iffy, feel free to change the 
recipes they use. Tier 1 is supposed to be the goto until mid-late game but not cheap enough to mass produce till late game (unless you 
have a stone mine :p). Tier 2 juice can only be made in a non-basic assembler and requires gold.

Volumes are setup to allow 2 juice items in a cockpit and 1 in the inventory. Note that juice items only work if they are in the inventory 
of the cockpit in use. Also they can pass through small conveyors.
